## Planned Features ##
  * Batch change to & from headers on DA2062
  * [Generic Batch Fill](GenericBatchFill.md) - Create generic method to batch fill any XFDL document.
  * Create digitally singable DA2062 (very long term goal).
  * Merge multiple DA-2062 documents into one file. (for people who currently have 9 files for one hand receipt).
